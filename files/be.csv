Scrum Framework,Computational Viewpoint,Process,Project Management and Collaboration,"Scrum is a software product development and management framework derived from agile principles and rooted in empiricism. Scrum enables teams to address complex challenges and deliver high-value products by enhancing collaboration, creativity, and productivity. Its core pillars of Adaptation, Inspection, and Transparency uphold the empiricism theory. Success with Scrum relies on embracing its five core values: Courage, Commitment, Openness, Respect, and Focus. The framework revolves around three key roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team, who drive self-organization throughout the sprint cycle. Scrum defines key events like Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, each serving a specific purpose in the sprint lifecycle. Its artifacts, including Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment, form the foundation of Scrum's empiricism. The framework's flexibility allows for control over work in progress (WIP) and emphasizes releasing increments that meet the Definition of Done (DoD) at any time during the sprint cycle. Daily Scrum fosters self-organization by facilitating team collaboration and addressing impediments, while Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective provide opportunities for inspection and improvement.",,, doi.org/10.35940/ijitee.C8545.019320

Publication Metrics,Enterprise (Science) Viewpoint,Characteristic,Impact and Outreach,"Publication metrics refer to various quantitative measures used to evaluate scholarly output. While the total number of papers published is a common metric, it may not fully capture the importance or impact of the work. Citation counts, which reflect how often a scholar's work is cited by others in the field, are often considered a more informative measure of scholarly impact. However, citation counts can be criticized for their potential inaccuracies and biases, such as being inflated by a few highly cited papers or including negative citations. The h-index, proposed by Hirsch in 2005, is another metric that measures scholarly output by considering both the number of papers published and the number of citations each paper receives. For example, an h-index of 21 indicates that a researcher has published 21 papers with at least 21 citations each. While some consider the h-index a superior metric for quantifying scientific achievement and predicting future success, critics argue that it may be biased and should be used in conjunction with other measures.
